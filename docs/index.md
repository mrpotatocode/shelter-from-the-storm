# From Subway to Shelter: An Exploratory Analysis of the Relation Between Subway Station Location and Shelter Occupancy Rate

### Abstract

*An exploratory data analysis was performed to examine if homeless shelter occupancy increases if the shelter is near a subway station. Using Open Data Toronto’s **Daily Shelter Occupancy, 2019** dataset and TTC subway locations, this relationship is explored in terms of whether shorter distance from a subway station can positively correlate to higher occupancy rates of shelters. A bivariate logistic regression was used to measure the variance in shelter occupancy rates by minimum distance from a subway station. A small, positive relationship was found at a significance level of p < .05. However, due to the positive skew of the data and possible covariates, conclusions from this regression have not been drawn at this time. Additionally, conclusions have been avoided with consideration to population vulnerability. Data processes and limitations are discussed in some depth and are intended for additional investigation and study replication.*

## Introduction

We all seek a place of rest and shelter. At the end of a long day, home
is often on the mind. But for the vulnerable population of a city, home
may not be an option. Shelters aim to offer this population places of
rest and respite. Shelters may serve as a temporary holdover until
something more permanent is found, or as a known place of shelter when
the larger world offers little comfort. However, people in this
population may not always have a personal means of transportation to
access these spaces and thus rely on public transit systems within close
proximity to make use of these shelters. As such, this report aims to
explore the relationship between subway stations and shelter occupancy
through the use of an exploratory data analysis.

### Research Question

Following the intent of this report, the posed question is: does the
distance from the nearest TTC subway station influence the rate of
occupancy of Toronto shelters?

### Limitations and Ethics

A major limitation of the approach of this analysis is that only TTC
subway stations were used as a means of measuring access to shelters by
public transit. It may be that the shelters furthest from a subway
station are served by other forms of transit (i.e. GO trains,
streetcars, or buses). This approach has the implicit assumption that
the people using Toronto shelters also use the subway as a consistent
means of transportation. Indeed, it may be the case that the subway is
one of the least used methods of transportation for this population.

Moreover, it may be the case that a given starting point of travel does
not necessitate the use of a subway. For instance, because subway
stations tend to be clustered around major social centres (e.g. schools,
hospitals, libraries), people using shelters may be using social
services in the area aside from the subway. Domain knowledge of typical
transportation use and shelter use is necessary for drawing further
conclusions, as it would aid in the efforts to understand how different
shelter types are used and the populations they serve.

This analysis does not consider shelter turnover (see §Ethics). As such,
it may be the case that shelters shown to be at or above capacity were
so because the people using them were there for extended periods of
time. In this regard, measuring occupancy rates is limited without
further understanding of the length of time people may reside in a given
shelter.

Regarding ethics, first and foremost, this data analysis examines a
vulnerable population. Any conclusions drawn about this population
should be done so with great care and consideration towards the people
who make up the population. Additionally, examining turnover would
require identifying and tracking individuals in and out of shelters.
This dataset did not provide this data and we strongly discourage any
efforts to analyze turnover without full ethics approval and appropriate
qualifications.

## Exploratory Analysis

### Datasets

The datasets used in the following exploratory analysis are the **[Daily
Shelter
Occupancy, 2019](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-occupancy/)**
and the **[TTC Subway Delay Data,
January 2018](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/)**.
Only TTC subway station names were extracted from the latter. This
analysis focused on daily shelter occupancy rates in 2019 only, though
2017 and 2018 were also available from Open Data Toronto.

### Data Cleaning

As the base data source for Principal Component Analysis, the Daily
Shelter Occupancy, 2019 dataset was quite clean. Using the visdat
package, mistyped columns (character to integer) and missing values were
resolved. Missing values were for days where shelter CAPACITY was
unknown (126 of 39429 records). Duplicates (28) were removed with the
get\_dupes function from the janitor package.

Some additional columns were derived: 1) From OCCUPANCY\_DATE, month and
day of week by use of the SQLDF package and SQLite query syntax; 2) From
OCCUPANCY and CAPACITY, rate \[of occupancy\], where rate is the
OCCUPANCY/CAPACITY.

As the supplement data source, the TTC subway data contained 39 (104 of
75) erroneous or duplicated subway stations. These were manually
resolved, as it was relatively quick to check the 75 subway stations
within the city. In hindsight, it might have been easier to pull from a
cleaner data source, such as a web call to Wikipedia or TTC’s
Stations\_A-Z.jsp.

With these cleaned data sources, the gmapsdistance package queried
Google Maps through our Google Cloud Developer API, in order to derive
the distance and the time to shelters from subway stations. The
gmapsdistance package requires vectorized origins and destinations and
returns a cartesian product: 4575 API calls were necessary to return 61
shelters as destinations and 75 subway stations as origins. The returned
product includes TIME, DISTANCE, and STATUS. Status was discarded. Time
and Distance were set as “walking” values. Though Time and Distance
represent two distinct real-world measurements, they are mathematically
corollary. The minimum Distance and Time was applied to each shelter and
the station name was added as a supplement.

While working to explore the relationship between distance and
occupancy, occupancy was made into a binary variable in which a shelter
was rated as either “full” or “not full”. Full was defined as 99% to
101% and not full was defined as below 99% and above 101%. This
attribute was utilized for bivariate binomial logistic regression
models.

### Descriptive Statistics & Final Dataset Shape

In *Table 1*, the mean capacity for shelters was *M* = 67, with a
standard deviation of *SD* = 111, while the occupancy for shelters had a
mean of *M* = 63, with a standard deviation of *SD* = 96. Importantly,
the mean rate of occupancy was *M* = 0.96 with a standard deviation of
*SD* = 0.15. This means Toronto shelters experienced a high rate of
occupancy throughout the year. Looking at the mean minimum distance,
shelters are an average *M* = 1653 metres (1.653 km) away from a subway
station with a standard deviation of *SD* = 1838 metres (1.838 km).
However, examining *Chart 1*, we can see that the data was clustered
between 0 km and 2.5 km, causing a positive skew, and thus better served
by using the mode as a measure of central tendency.

*Table 1*

To more closely examine the relationship between distance from a subway
station and shelter occupancy rates, a logistic regression was performed
using a binomial model, with shelter rating (“full” or “not full”) as
the dependent variable and minimum distance as the independent variable.
Looking at *Table 2*, with a *B<sub>0</sub>* = -0.238 and a
*B<sub>1</sub>* = 0.0000131, it can be understood that with each point
increase in distance the predicted log odds of the shelter occupancy
being full increased by 0.0000131. This relationship was significant at
*p* = 0.0177. As a related exploration, the relationship between the
closest and furthest shelters from subway stations and those shelters’
occupancy rates were investigated. This relationship can be seen in
*Chart 2*, where nearly all of the top 10% (n=7) of shelters furthest
from subway stations operate at or above capacity, in contrast to the
top 10% (n=7) of shelters closest to subways stations operating below
total shelter capacity. Confounding variables (e.g. shelter capacity and
other forms of transit) and data skewness may explain the significance
of this relationship.

## Conclusion

The aim of this analysis was to answer the question: does the distance
from any nearest TTC subway station influence the rate of occupancy of
Toronto shelters? By combining both Daily Shelter Occupancy for 2019 and
TTC subway locations, we explored this relationship by measuring the
nearest subway station to each shelter. From this dataset, shelter
occupancy rate was considered as a binary variable (“full” or “not
full”) to correlate distance between subway stations and shelters’
occupancy rate by use of bivariate logistic regression.

As mentioned within §Ethics, we do not feel this question has been
answered by this exploratory data analysis. While a significant, small,
positive relationship was revealed, confounding variables may explain
the significance of this relationship. Special consideration has been
made to maintain the general structure and design of the original
dataset in order to allow domain experts to supplement additional
confounding factors.

Finally, we note that this analysis revealed that shelters are often
operating at capacity regardless of distance from a subway station.
